    <td width="100%">Sigurbjorn was born Dec. 29, 1839, at Thingeysarsysla, Reykjadal, in Northern 
Iceland. He married Maria, daughter of Jon Halldorson and Ingibjorg 
Erlendsdottir, who was born in 1861, at North Thingeysarsysla, Iceland. They 
immigrated to Canada in 1889, with their daughter, Jakobina, born Oct. 24, 1883, 
and a son who became very ill enroute and died shortly after coming to Argyle. 
Their second daughter, Sigurveig, was born Feb. 17, 1890 (married John Arnason 
Sveinsson). Their second son, Egill, born 1893, died at the age of 24.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On coming to Canada, Sigurbjorn and his family joined his 
brother, Johann Johannson, who had taken the name of Reykdal and lived on NW 
14-6-14. Sigurbjorn later lived on 8-6-14. Jakobina and Sigurveig attended Bru 
School and the family attended Grund Church.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sigurbjorn had been a poet and a &quot;community skald&quot; in 
Iceland, and in Argyle he continued in this role, writing and composing poems 
about birthdays, weddings, and funerals. In 1902, his friends Thorstein Johnson 
and Bjorn Walterson published a collection of his poetry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Johansson home, many long winter evenings were 
devoted to reading and discussion of literature, the Scriptures, poetry, the 
Sagas. As a result, Sigurbjorn's daughters retained a life-long interest in and 
love for literature, particularly poetry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Sigurbjorn died in 1903, at the age of 64, his home 
was moved to the farm of Arni Sveinsson, where Maria lived for some time. She 
later lived with her daughter and son-in-law, Sigurveig and John Sveinsson, who 
cared for her until her death in 1916.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jakobina attended Bru School, then normal school in 
Winnipeg. At the age of 16 she undertook her first teaching position at a school 
in New Iceland. She then taught at Frey in Argyle. She married Isak Johnson, a 
building contractor. They lived in Winnipeg, then moved to Seattle, Washington. 
Jakobina's early interest in, and study of literature led her to writing poetry 
and to translating Icelandic poetry into English. She was also very active in 
Seattle, lecturing in the city and at the university [of Washington] on 
Icelandic literature and culture, as well as working with Icelandic cultural 
societies. In 1933, at the age of 50 years, she was honored by the Icelandic 
government for her contribution to Icelandic culture in American with a 
government-sponsored trip to Iceland, where she was invested with that country's 
most distinguished honour, The Order of the Falcon. Later, she enjoyed a second 
trip to Iceland, this time a gift from a group of Icelandic university students 
in Seattle who had boarded with her, and wished to thank her and pay tribute to 
her for her interest and aid. The Johnson's home in Seattle was unique because 
of its unusual early-period design and construction. Jakobina's extensive 
library and her collection of art works and artifacts, particularly from the 
Orient, made her home in its own way, a centre of cultural interest. Jakobina 
died in 1977, at the age of 94. Jakobina and Isak had 7 children: Kari, Ingolf, 
Konrad, Harold, Marie, Johann, and Stephan.</p>
