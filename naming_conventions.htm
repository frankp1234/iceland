<h2>A note about Icelandic naming conventions...</h2>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="600">
  <tr>
    <td><p>A son takes his father's first name and adds <i>-sson, </i>which then becomes 
his surname. So Johann, the son of Isak, becomes Johann Isaksson.<p>&nbsp;<p>A daughter also takes her father's first name and adds <i>-sdottir. </i>Thus 
Stephanie, daughter of Johann, becomes Stephanie Johannsdottir.</p>
<p>People keep these names the rest of their lives, even after marriage. Women 
do not take their husband's surname.</p>
<p>To use the phonebook in Iceland, you look the person up by the first name and 
then by the last. If this is not enough, they are listed by occupation.</p>
<p>This tradition makes keeping family histories easier, and helps explain the long 
genealogy 
we have for our family.</p>
